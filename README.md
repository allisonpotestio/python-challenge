module 3 challenge
I received a lot of help with both exercises from tutoring session wih Limei Hou. Limei helped to guide me through the two areas I was stuck with -- calculating the change between months for the PyBank data and calculating the percentage of votes in PyPoll
I also consulted stack overflow on issues with the header in the csv file -- how to get the code to skip the header
