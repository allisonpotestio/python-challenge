# python-challenge
module 3 challenge--
PyBank_Code2.py and PyPoll_Code2.py within the Starter_Code folder are the files to be graded, since the path is correct with those
I received a lot of help with both exercises from tutoring session wih Limei Hou. Limei helped to guide me through the two areas I was stuck with -- calculating the change between months for the PyBank data and calculating the percentage of votes in PyPoll.

I also consulted stack overflow on issues with the header in the csv file -- how to get the code to skip the header
